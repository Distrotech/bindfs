{"name":"Bindfs","tagline":"Mount a directory elsewhere with changed permissions.","body":"\r\nbindfs  -  http://code.google.com/p/bindfs/\r\n\r\n-- Overview --\r\n\r\nbindfs is a FUSE filesystem for mirroring a directory to another\r\ndirectory, similarly to mount --bind. The permissions of the mirrored\r\ndirectory can be altered in various ways.\r\n\r\nSome things bindfs can be used for:\r\n - Making a directory read-only.\r\n - Making all executables non-executable.\r\n - Sharing a directory with a list of users (or groups).\r\n - Modifying permission bits using rules with chmod-like syntax.\r\n - Changing the permissions with which files are created.\r\n\r\nNon-root users can use almost all features, but most interesting\r\nuse-cases need user_allow_other to be defined in /etc/fuse.conf\r\n\r\n\r\n-- Installation --\r\n\r\nMake sure fuse 2.5.3 or above is installed (http://fuse.sf.net/).\r\nThen compile and install as usual:\r\n./configure\r\nmake\r\nmake install\r\n\r\nIf you want the mounts made by non-root users to be visible to other users,\r\nyou may have to add the line user_allow_other to /etc/fuse.conf.\r\n\r\n\r\n-- Usage --\r\n\r\nSee the bindfs --help or the man-page for instructions and examples.\r\n\r\n\r\n-- License --\r\n\r\nGNU General Public License version 2 or any later version.\r\nSee the file COPYING.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
